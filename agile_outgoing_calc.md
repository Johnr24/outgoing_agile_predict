Agile Outgoing 

Agile Outgoing pays customers a price for electricity exported based on the day ahead half hourly auction conducted at 3:45pm local time on EPEXSPOT (part of EEX). You can see the latest auction results on their website, however unfortunately no historic data is publicly available. The prices on the EPEXSPOT website are in Â£/MWh and don't include any VAT, to convert these to p/kWh, you need to divide by 10.

To calculate the retail price for your region:

    multiply the wholesale price in p/kWh by the multiplier shown
    For all periods, add the first adder shown
    For any periods from 4-7pm local time, add the second adder shown
    (There is no VAT on exported power)
    Floor the resultant price at 0p/kWh
