                <p>
                    This model attempts to forecasts Octopus Agile electricity prices up to 14 days in advance using a
                    Machine Learning model trained on data from the Balancing Mechanism Reporting System (<a
                        href="https://bmrs.elexon.co.uk/"
                        >BRMS</a
                    >), National Grid Electricity Supply Operator (<a href="https://www.nationalgrideso.com/data-portal"
                        >NG ESO</a
                    >) and weather data from<a href="https://open-meteo.com"> open-meteo.com</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The model runs in Python using the
                    <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#">XGBoost</a> Gradient Boosting library,
                    <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a>. The model is trained on a combination of
                    historic actual data and historic forecasts together with the actual Outgoing Agile prices. As more forecasts
                    are processed the model should <i>learn</i> and improve its predictions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The forecasts should get automatically updated at 6:30, 11:30 and 16:30 daily. For each update the
                    model is run 50 times to estimate the uncertainty in the prediction. It should be note that this
                    approach only accounts for the uncertainty in the model and not the uncertainty in the underlying
                    forecasts or generation, demand and weather.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This model is very much work in progress: use it at your own risk! Overall trends are more likely to
                    be accurate than the half-hourly slot details.
