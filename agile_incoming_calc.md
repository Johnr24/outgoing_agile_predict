Agile Incoming

Agile charges customers a price for electricity purchased based on the day ahead half hourly auction conducted at 3:45pm local time on EPEXSPOT (part of EEX). You can see the latest auction results on their website, however unfortunately no historic data is publicly available. The prices on the EPEXSPOT website are in Â£/MWh and don't include any VAT, to convert these to p/kWh, you need to divide by 10.

To calculate the retail price for your region:

    multiply the wholesale price in p/kWh by the multiplier shown
    For any periods from 4-7pm local time, add the adder shown
    Multiply the price by 1.05 to include VAT
    Cap the resultant price at 35p/kWh
